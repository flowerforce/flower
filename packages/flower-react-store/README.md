Flower React Store is a package designed to instantiate a shared Redux store context for multiple packages.
This ensures a single source of truth across different modules, enabling seamless state management and communication between components.
It allows you to inject custom reducers to work with flower rules and validation integration.
Now you can inject even reducers made by rtk-query
