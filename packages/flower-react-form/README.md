Flower React Form is a form management library for React.
Built on top of Flower Core, it can be easily integrated with FlowerReact or used independently while preserving Flowerâ€™s key features, such as render optimization, automatic data handling, and validation rule management.

For more info [flowerjs.it/](https://flowerjs.it/)

## Features

- **Data handling**: Read and write data to the global Redux store.
- **Form validation**: Built-in functionalities to validate individual inputs and the entire form.

### Installation

Flower React Form can be installed via npm or yarn for use in any JavaScript project.

### Using npm

1. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.
2. Run the following command to install the library:

```bash
#NPM
npm install @flowerforce/flower-react-form
```

### Using yarn

1. Ensure you have yarn installed on your system.
2. Run the following command to install the library:

```bash
#YARN
yarn add @flowerforce/flower-react-form
```

## Configuration

Flower React Form works with redux global state.

If you starts an application with Flower React Form from scratch, you need to wrap your application with ***FormProvider***
The **FormProvider** component wraps the entire application, providing a global context for managing the application flow.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { FormProvider } from '@flowerforce/flower-react-form'

function Root() {
  return (
    <FormProvider>
      <App />
    </FormProvider>
  )
}
```

If your application is already built with redux as global state manager, you can use differents approaches:

- Separates Providers

In this case, you need to wrap your application with the ***FormProvider*** component in addition to the classic Redux provider.
The order of providers is not relevant, since their redux contexts are different.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { Provider } from 'react-redux'
import { yourStore } from 'yourStore'
import { FormProvider } from '@flowerforce/flower-react-form'

function Root() {
  return (
    <Provider store={yourStore}>
      <FormProvider>  
        <App />
      </FormProvider>
    </Provider>
  )
}
```
- Single Provider

For this scenario, we provides ***createStoreWithFlowerData***
This functions takes a `configureStoreOptions` object (same as createStore from redux) and an optional `middlewaresBlacklist`, since flower inject automatically some middlewares in its store.
To generate slices fully compatible, you can use ***createSliceWithFlowerData***, a function same as `createSlice` from redux.
Let's see the needed configuration
```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { Provider } from 'react-redux'
import { FormProvider, createStoreWithFlowerData, createSliceWithFlowerData } from '@flowerforce/flower-react-form'

const myStoreWithFlower = createSliceWithFlowerData({
  name: 'myStore',
  initialData: {},
  reducers: {
    add: (state) => {
      state.count += 1
    }
  }
})

const storeWithFlower = createStoreWithFlowerData({
  reducer: {
      myStore: myStoreWithFlower.reducer,
    }
})

function Root() {
  return (
    <Provider store={storeWithFlower}>
      <App />
    </Provider>
  )
}
```

In this scenario, we need a single provider, so we use the default redux provider

### N.B.: If form is used combined with flower-react, take a look to Configuration chapter of flower-react docs.

## How to use

### Simple Example

The **FlowerForm** component defines a form with a specific name, which serves as a unique identifier for the form. It is the main component for defining forms, accepting a required "name" property and an initialState field for prepopulating values.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { FlowerForm, FlowerField } from '@flowerforce/flower-react-form'

export const Page = () => {
    <FlowerForm
      name="form-test"
      initialState={{ name: 'andrea', surname: 'rossi' }}
    >
      <FlowerField
        id="name"
        validate={[
          {
            message: 'is equal',
            rules: { $and: [{ name: { $eq: 'andrea' } }] }
          }
        ]}
      >
        your input component...
      </FlowerField>
      <FlowerField
        id="surname"
        validate={[
          {
            message: 'is equal',
            rules: { $and: [{ surname: { $eq: 'rossi' } }] }
          }
        ]}
      >
        your input component...
      </FlowerField>
    </FlowerForm>
  
}
```

### Hook - useFlowerForm

Here, we are using the useFlower hook to obtain some essential functions for navigation and handling of the application flow.

#### useFlowerForm as child <FlowerForm>...</FlowerForm>

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { FlowerForm, FlowerField } from '@flowerforce/flower-react-form'

const ViewFormState = () => {
  const { isValid, getData, setData, ...rest } = useFlowerForm()
  return <span>{isValid}</span>
}

export const Page = () => {
    <FlowerForm
      name="form-test"
      initialState={{ name: 'andrea', surname: 'rossi' }}
    >
      <FlowerField
        id="name"
        validate={[
          {
            message: 'is equal',
            rules: { $and: [{ name: { $eq: 'andrea' } }] }
          }
        ]}
      >
        your input component...
      </FlowerField>
      <FlowerField
        id="surname"
        validate={[
          {
            message: 'is equal',
            rules: { $and: [{ surname: { $eq: 'rossi' } }] }
          }
        ]}
      >
        your input component...
      </FlowerField>
      <ViewFormState />
    </FlowerForm>
  
}
```

#### External use of useFlowerForm

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { FlowerForm, FlowerField } from '@flowerforce/flower-react-form'

export const Page = () => {
  const { isValid, getData, setData, ...rest } = useFlowerForm('form-test')

    return  (
    <FlowerForm
      name="form-test"
      initialState={{ name: 'andrea', surname: 'rossi' }}
    >
      <FlowerField
        id="name"
        validate={[
          {
            message: 'is equal',
            rules: { $and: [{ name: { $eq: 'andrea' } }] }
          }
        ]}
      >
        your input component...
      </FlowerField>
      <FlowerField
        id="surname"
        validate={[
          {
            message: 'is equal',
            rules: { $and: [{ surname: { $eq: 'rossi' } }] }
          }
        ]}
      >
        your input component...
      </FlowerField>
      <ViewFormState />
    </FlowerForm>
    )
  
}
```
